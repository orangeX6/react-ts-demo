/*
-> TypeScript is a 'superset' of JavaScript.
-> Typescript adds static typing to JavaScript
-> JS on its own is dynamically typed 
-> TypeScript does not run in the browser. -> TypeScript Code is converted to JavaScript in the browser

-> Basic Types
>> Primitives : number, string, boolean
>> More Complex Types: Arrays, Objects
>> Function types, Parameters

->> Type Inference
let course = 'React - the complete guide';
course = 12341;
>> this will give an error. TypeScript tries to infer the type of the variable automatically if we don't provide the type.
>> Its a better approach to embrace the type inference and not unnecessarily specify the type explicitly.

-> Using Union Types

-> Type Aliases

-> Generics 
>> Generics helps you write functions which are type Safe yet flexible
